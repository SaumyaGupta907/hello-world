	HTML is a standard markup language for creating webpages. It was initially developed by Tim Berners-Lee. It acts as a skeleton of a web page and consists of tags called elements which tell the browser about how to display the content. The elements label the content such as the heading, paragraph etc. The generally contain a start tag, some content and an end tag (Eg/- <code>head</code> tag)except for empty tags which have no content (Eg/- <code>br</code> tag). The web browsers read the HTML file and display the content accordingly.
